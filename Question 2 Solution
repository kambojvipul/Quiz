Ans 2 A) I have gone through the Inout A and out B, where the function is 

B = f(A)

Function = x * 100 + y * 10 + z * 1

where x, y, z are a-z or A-Z or 0-9.

I have gound that inputs are of three digits between 000 to 999.


Ans 2 B) To find values of inputs a-z, A-Z, 0-9 does not seem to be possible with data. I tried with ASCII code, it did not work out. I could not find pattern in data. What i found is above equation. 


And 2 C) Maximum would be :

every input is having maximum value that is 999.

x=y=z=999

maximum output = 999*100 + 999*10 + 999 = 110889
min = 0
